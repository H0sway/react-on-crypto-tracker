# Personal CryptoCurrency Tracker

The purpose of this app is to provide users with their own personal tracker for their cryptocurrency investments, as well as allow them to keep up to date with the value of the most popular currencies. Users will be able to create their own accounts where they can add currencies to their own personal tables. They will be shown relevant information about each currency as well as details on their own investments, such as the amount they own and it's value in US Dollars.
